To develop AI tools that are truly practical and easy to use, we need a full-stack project scaffold.
For this purpose, I developed a full-stack AI Agent POC project, which includes the following core components:

 

•	Azure AI Agent and the gpt-4o model deployed on Azure AI Foundry
o	The Azure AI Agent is a fully managed AI Agent hosted on Azure cloud, using the gpt-4o large model deployed on Azure AI Foundry as the analysis engine.
•	Customized MCP server
o	A custom MCP server service can provide various data and information. For example, LiuLin developed PrismMCPServer to fetch data from various RCIS platforms.
•	Backend service built with FastAPI
o	The FastAPI service provides three main capabilities: communicating with the frontend app to receive user prompts; acting as an MCP client to connect to the MCP server; and acting as an Agent Client to operate the cloud-based Agent.
•	Frontend app built with React
o	The frontend app offers a much more user-friendly interactive environment compared to CLI commands.
